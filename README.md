EduflowGL is a C++ Application for doing flow simulation based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). It is designed to be used in educational settings, but can also be used for research purposes. The application is based on the [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) and [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) libraries for visualization and the [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) library for parallel computation on NVIDIA GPUs.

The code was originally developed by Stephan Lenz at the Insitute for computational modeling in civil engineering at the TU Braunschweig. After the original code was lost, the code was reworked by Fahad Zahid in 2024 in the context of his specialization project. He mainly added new features and improved the code structure, containerized the application and added a CI/CD pipeline.
